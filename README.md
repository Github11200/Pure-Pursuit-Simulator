# Pure-Pursuit-Simulator
This is a simple simulator I made that lets you simulate the pure pursuit algorithm and get the way points for the algorithm for the Vex Robotics Competition.

Prequesites for running the program:
  - NPM
  - Node JS
  - Text editor (I will be using VS Code)

1) Download the source code
2) Open it in a text editor such as VS Code
3) From the built in terminal in VS Code use the `cd` command and go to the Simulator folder.
4) Now run the command, `npm run dev`.
5) This should give you a localhost link from which you can view the project.
